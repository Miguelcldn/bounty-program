# Software Bounty Program

We are running a bounty program to complete the projected functionality as soon as possible. Currently bounties are not paid in cash, but in Fermat tokens. This is one of the ways we use to distribute ownership of the project with whoever adds value to it. 

# Types of projects 

1.	**GUI/UX:** The goal pursued is to analyze the problem and design a good solution for it. For instance, the team that decides to take a project of this kind shall describe exhaustively the functionality, graphic interfaces and user's experience related to the solution. The deliverables expected are: functionality document, mockups, graphic design components.

2.	**Analysis:** The target is the development of the engineering that makes possible to implement the solution designed in GUI/UX project, in other words, identify which components are required and how interact with each other. The deliverables expected are: components and workflows uploaded in fermat.org

3.	**Implementation:** It is the execution of the plan described in the GUI/UX and analysis' projects. It requires developing and testing the solution. The deliverables expected are: working solution after alpha testing stage.

The projects described above could be and should be done for different teams, because each of them requires and unique set of skills.

## Sign-up - License Agreement - (READ FIRST)
Anyone who adds value to the Project in any form needs to sign up a Contribution License Agreement as the first step to become part of the project. To do that, please follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program/tree/master/license-agreements/README.md) 

Now, after signing up,  you can follow the Bounty program procedure below.

## Procedure

1. Grab a Team and apply for one of the projects listed whose status reads as _Not Assigned_ (if you are already a member of the bitDubai network you can only participate on the projects you are assigned to, if it happens that that project has a bounty then you are automatically participating on the bounty-program together with the team that is working on that).

2. Create an Issue in this REPO tagging the @bounty-program-team asking to assign to your team the project you are interested in.

3. Someone on this team will evaluate your skills and may or may not assign the project to your team. In any case a complete explanation of the reasons why they do or don't assign it will be given to you. Everything will happen in the disscussion on the issue created.

4. The exact scope of the project is defined once the project is assigned to a team. It is agreed between the team members and the @bounty-program-team.

## Rules

1.	The projects oriented to solve each problem must be taken in the following order : GUI/UX, Analysis and then Implementation. No one can take a Analysis project if the GUI/UX stage is still in process, and the same with respect to Implementation project and the Analysis stage.

2.	To take a project you must put your name and date in the table of bounties and then you have one week to prepare an agreement or project charter that describes the scope, the time needed to finish it, and the acceptance criteria to consider the work done. The @bounty-program-team will evaluate your proposal and decide if take it or not.

3.	Once @bounty-program-team accepts the project charter will write the finish date in the bounty table.

4.	On the finish date each team must showcase the deliveries associated with the project taken and the jury will evaluate, according to the project charter, if the bounty is should be awarded or not.

5.	If you miss the target month for any reason you can still be awarded half of the bounty if you reach the targe phase the following month.

6.	A team has to maintain the code implemented during the first 3 months in production.

7.	The team will be awarded a 10% extra of the bounty received for each of these 3 months.

8.	The distribution of the bounty between the team members is free. It is up to the team to decide how to distribute the bounty between them or other people from other teams that helped.

9.	Team leaders can make agreements for tokens of the possible bounty with other team leaders to help them with the project. In fact this is expected to happend with graphic designers, UX designers, copywriters and others, in order to secure their commitment to the project for certain dates.

10.	Reaching production phase means passing all controls, checks and approvals that might be in place by the time the code is implemented. Those approval procedures might or might not be in place at present time.

11.	The conditions of bounties that are not yet Assigned might be changed at anytime by the @bounty-program-team. Once assigned, the conditions will stay fixed.

12.	If the @bounty-program-team sees a lack of commitment of a team with the project assigned or a the progress is too slow, it might cancel the assigment and return the project to the pool of Not Assigned bounties.

13.	If you achieve it within the target you will get 100% of the bounty (of course), if you make it during the next 30 days after the deadline you'll get 50%, from day 31 to 60 you'll get 0, from day 61 to 90 you will have to pay 50% in tokens and from day 91 to 120 you will pay 100% of the tokens.

14.	The agreement document or project charter will be updated once the bounty is won with a distribution table where all beneficiaries will be listed together with the percentage that they will receive.

15.	The payment of the bounty will be done when the project is released to general public (production). The amount of Tokens to receive will be calculated at the Tokens price at the date the project is relesed to the public.

16.	The bounty awarded expires after 30 days of the DEMO day if the project has not been released.

17.	A Team cannot participate on other bounty of this program until the current one they are working at is released (production).

18.	Team members cannot leave the team for other teams before the project reaches the phase specified on this bounty program. The only way to leave is leaving the Fermat project.

19.	GUI/UX and Analysis project types have one free review. The following reviews without approval will cost the team 25% of the bounty each.
