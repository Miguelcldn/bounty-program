# Fermat Bounty Program

We are running a bounty program to complete the projected functionality as soon as possible. Currently bounties are not paid in cash, but in Fermat tokens. This is one of the ways we use to distribute ownership of the project with whoever adds value to it. 

## License Agreement (read this first)
Anyone who adds value to the Project in any form needs to sign up a Contribution License Agreement as the first step to become part of the project. To do that, you only need to do the following:
 

1. In the following link you will find the Contributor License Agreement template file that you need to sign up ([here](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program/blob/master/license-agreements/Contributor-License-Agreement.md))
2. Copy all of its content to the clipboard 
3. Go to the folder [Bounty-program-license-agreements](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program/tree/master/license-agreements/Bounty-program-license-agreements)

4. Create a new file starting with your "GitHub alias"-"(name)"-and the name of the template file.
5. Paste the content of the clipboard in it and save it.
6. You are done!

#### Example: 

```shell
Juan-Perez-Contributor-License-Agreement.md
```

<br>
#### Be Aware! : 

| Note:        | By adding this file to this repo you are signing it with your github account and agreeing on the terms and conditions mentioned there.            |

#### After Signing: 

Now you are signed up and can follow the Bounty program procedure below.

## Procedure

1. Grab a Team and apply for one of the projects listed whose status reads as _Not Assigned_ (if you are already a member of the bitDubai network you can only participate on the projects you are assigned to, if it happens that that project has a bounty then you are automatically participating on the bounty-program together with the team that is working on that.)
2. Create an Issue in this REPO tagging the @bounty-program-team asking to assign to your team the project you are interested in.
3. Someone on this team will evaluate your skills and may or may not assign the project to your team. In any case a complete explanation of the reasons why they do or don't assign it will be given to you. Everything will happen in the disscussion on the issue created.
4. The exact scope of the project is defined once the project is assigned to a team. It is agreed between the team members and the @bounty-program-team.

## Rules

1. If you miss the target month for any reason you can still be awarded half of the bounty if you reach production the following month.
2. Your team has to maintain the code implemented during the first 3 months of production. 
3. You wil be awarded a 10% extra of the bounty received for each of these 3 months.
4. The distribution of the bounty between the team members is free. It is up to the team to decide how to distribute the bounty between them or other people from other teams that helped.
5. Team leaders can make agreements for tokens of the possible bounty with other team leaders to help them with the project. In fact this is expected to happend with graphic designers, UX designers, copywriters and others, in order to secure their commitment to the project for certain dates.
6. Taking the functionality into production means passing all controls, checks and approvals that might be in place by the time the code is implemented. This approval procedures might or might not be in place at the present time.
7. The conditions of bounties that are not yet _Assigned_ might be changed at anytime by the @bounty-program-team. Once assigned, the conditions will stay fixed.
8. If the @bounty-program-team sees a lack of commitment of a team with the project assigned or a progress too slow, it might cancel the assigment and return the project to the pool of _Not Assigned_ bounties.
9. Some projects might require a collateral in fermat tokens provided by the team members. These tokens will be held as a deposit during the period the team is working for the bounty. If they fail to win the bounty the collateral will be lost.
10. A short _agreement_ will be added to the _agreements_ folder in this repo with the conditions agreed by the team and the @bounty-program-team.
